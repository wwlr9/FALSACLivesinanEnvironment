# FALSAC Lives in an Environment

In The Restless Clock, Riskin states that “a thing cannot be conscious without having agency, but it can have agency without being conscious.” What is the nature of agency and life? This question has been debated in many fields including philosophy and biology. With this question in mind, I conducted multidisciplinary research and made _FALSAC Lives in an Environment_, a simulation art installation. I explored to what extent a system could be alive and where a “seemingly existing agency” could exist, in the context of **survival**.

Supported by a relatively stable internal environment, living systems survive in their disturbing external environment. This statement describes a critical concept in physiology, called homeostasis. Inspired by several concepts in biology, from homeostasis to stress physiology, in _FALSAC Lives in an Environment_, I fantasize about the internal and external environment of FALSAC(Fantasized Artificial Living System Alike Centrolenidae(glass frog)) in its algorithm.

In brief, FALSAC is a living system and thus an open system. FALSAC's internal system maintains its internal environment in a relatively stable state through negative feedback. FALSAC's external environment is intrinsically disturbing with stimuli(beneficial or adverse). In three different states of its external environment, FALSAC exhibits four different states of its internal environment, resulting in either its survival or death. This narrative implies several critical abilities FALSAC owned.

The measure of key parameters of FALSAC’s internal and external environment is visualized.

Through this piece, I invite people to engage **three questions** with me: Does a pursuit of survival supported by homeostasis imply a biological agency in an artificial living system like FALSAC? In addition or alternative to higher cognitive functions, could there be other strategies for an artificial living system to sense the threat and thus fight to survive in its external environment? If developing AIs with a will of survival could show comparative biological agency, how should we envision future human-AI relationships?

This project is developed for Tiange's Thesis at ITP, NYU Tisch.

## What You May Want to Know
### Agency
“But if we break down agency into its constituents, we can see how it might arise even in the absence of a mind that ‘thinks’, at least in the traditional sense. Agency stems from two ingredients: first, an ability to produce different responses to identical (or equivalent) stimuli, and second, to select between them in a goal-directed way. Neither of these capacities is unique to humans, nor to brains in general.”–Philip Ball, _Life with Purpose_

“A thing cannot be consciout without having agency, but it can have agency without being conscious."–Jessica Riskin, _The Restless Clock_

### Homeostasis
“Organisms, composed of material which is characterized by the utmost inconsistency and unsteadiness, have somehow learned the methods of maintaining constancy and keeping steady in the presence of conditions which might reasonably be expected to prove profoundly disturbing.” –Walter Cannon, American Physiologist

### What happened to FALSAC
In terms of homeostasis, FALSAC’s “life” is supported by its internal system. This system includes a control center, gland A, gland B, and paths between them. FALSAC, as a “living system,” is also an open system, meaning that FALSAC could exchange matter and energy with FALSAC’s external environment to live.

FALSAC “lives” in this environment. Without external stimuli in this environment, FALSAC’s internal system does a normal amount of work.

There will be times at which external stimuli appear in this environment affecting FALSAC’s internal environment.

One kind of stimulus is handleable. When FALSAC’s internal environment is affected by those stimuli and FALSAC senses this change in its internal environment, FALSAC starts to do more work supported by its internal system to maintain the relative constancy of its internal environment.

However, there will be times at which external stimuli are non-handleable. Non-handleable stimuli would lead to problems of FALSAC’s internal system as it does too much work. Without a relatively constant internal environment over time, FALSAC is no longer “alive.”

But this result could be preventable. Before non-handleable stimuli appear, if FALSAC has experienced enough times of handleable stimuli, FALSAC somehow gains the ability to foresee that this is the presence of non-handleable stimuli before its internal system’s failure. In this case, FALSAC applies its built-in fight mechanism. Then, as FALSAC’s internal system restores, FALSAC survives.

## Special Thanks
I want to sincerely thank everyone who has supported me through my ITP thesis journey.
Through this project, FALSAC has become unique to me. Without everyone's support, FALSAC would never be there and be in my heart.
