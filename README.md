# FALSAC Lives in an Environment

In The Restless Clock, Riskin states that “a thing cannot be conscious without having agency, but it can have agency without being conscious.” "What is the nature of agency and life" is debated in many fields, including philosophy and biology. With this question, I conducted interdisciplinary research, resulting in _FALSAC Lives in an Environment_, a simulation exploring the extent to which a system could be alive and where a "seemingly existing agency" exists in the context of survival.

Supported by a relatively stable internal environment, living systems survive in their disturbing external environment. Inspired by several concepts in biology, from homeostasis to stress physiology, in _FALSAC Lives in an Environment_, I fantasize about the internal and external environment of FALSAC(Fantasized Artificial Living System Alike Centrolenidae(glass frog)) in its algorithm.

Briefly, FALSAC is a living system and, thus, an open system. FALSAC's internal system maintains its internal environment in a relatively stable state through negative feedback. FALSAC's external environment is affected by stimuli (beneficial or adverse). In three different states of its external environment, FALSAC exhibits four states of its internal environment, resulting in either its survival or death, implying several critical abilities FALSAC should possess. This raises the question: how much of this framework is needed to see “agency” in FALSAC?

The measure of key parameters of FALSAC’s internal and external environment is visualized.

This artwork does not aim to provide an answer about the nature of agency and life. Rather, its goal is to raise awareness of this question that has been in the human mind from the past to the present and into the future. This artwork documents one way we can approach it and the specific difficulties we might face.

## What You May Want to Know
### Agency
“But if we break down agency into its constituents, we can see how it might arise even in the absence of a mind that ‘thinks’, at least in the traditional sense. Agency stems from two ingredients: first, an ability to produce different responses to identical (or equivalent) stimuli, and second, to select between them in a goal-directed way. Neither of these capacities is unique to humans, nor to brains in general.”–Philip Ball, _Life with Purpose_

“A thing cannot be consciout without having agency, but it can have agency without being conscious."–Jessica Riskin, _The Restless Clock_

### Homeostasis
“Organisms, composed of material which is characterized by the utmost inconsistency and unsteadiness, have somehow learned the methods of maintaining constancy and keeping steady in the presence of conditions which might reasonably be expected to prove profoundly disturbing.” –Walter Cannon, American Physiologist

### What happened to FALSAC
In terms of homeostasis, FALSAC’s “life” is supported by its internal system. This system includes a control center, gland A, gland B, and paths between them. FALSAC, as a “living system,” is also an open system, meaning that FALSAC could exchange matter and energy with FALSAC’s external environment to live.

FALSAC “lives” in this environment. Without external stimuli in this environment, FALSAC’s internal system does a normal amount of work.

There will be times at which external stimuli appear in this environment affecting FALSAC’s internal environment.

One kind of stimulus is handleable. When FALSAC’s internal environment is affected by those stimuli and FALSAC senses this change in its internal environment, FALSAC starts to do more work supported by its internal system to maintain the relative constancy of its internal environment.

However, there will be times at which external stimuli are non-handleable. Non-handleable stimuli would lead to problems of FALSAC’s internal system as it does too much work. Without a relatively constant internal environment over time, FALSAC is no longer “alive.”

But this result could be preventable. Before non-handleable stimuli appear, if FALSAC has experienced enough times of handleable stimuli, FALSAC somehow gains the ability to foresee that this is the presence of non-handleable stimuli before its internal system’s failure. In this case, FALSAC applies its built-in fight mechanism. Then, as FALSAC’s internal system restores, FALSAC survives.

## Special Thanks
I want to sincerely thank everyone who has supported me through my ITP thesis journey.
Through this project, FALSAC has become unique to me. Without everyone's support, FALSAC would never be there and be in my heart.
