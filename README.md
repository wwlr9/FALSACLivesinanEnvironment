# FALSAC Lives in an Environment

Before talking about sentience and consciousness, what is the nature of agency and life? This is one of the ultimate questions debated in many fields, including philosophy, biology, etc. Building on selected features for what I think a living system should have, emphasizing the concept of homeostasis, I experiment to what extent a system could be alive and where a “seemingly existing agency” could exist.

In _FALSAC Lives in an Environment_, I fantasized about FALSAC’s internal and external environment. Several biological concepts have inspired me, but this project does not aim for educational purposes. It is my experimentation for personal artistic and philosophical pursuits: the nature of **agency** and **life**.

This project is developed for my Thesis at ITP, NYU Tisch.

### Reading
In terms of homeostasis, FALSAC’s “life” is supported by its internal system. This system includes a control center, gland A, gland B, and paths between them. FALSAC, as a “living system,” is also an open system, meaning that FALSAC could exchange matter and energy with FALSAC’s external environment to live.

FALSAC “lives” in this environment. Without external stimuli in this environment, FALSAC’s internal system does a normal amount of work.

There will be times at which external stimuli appear in this environment affecting FALSAC’s internal environment.

One kind of stimulus is handleable. When FALSAC’s internal environment is affected by those stimuli and FALSAC senses this change in its internal environment, FALSAC starts to do more work supported by its internal system to maintain the relative constancy of its internal environment.

However, there will be times at which external stimuli are non-handleable. Non-handleable stimuli would lead to problems of FALSAC’s internal system as it does more work. Without a relatively constant internal environment over time, FALSAC is no longer “alive.”

But this result could be preventable. Before non-handleable stimuli appear, if FALSAC has experienced enough times of handleable stimuli, FALSAC somehow gains the ability to foresee that this is the presence of non-handleable stimuli before its internal system’s failure. In this case, FALSAC applies its built-in fight mechanism. Then, as FALSAC’s internal system restores, FALSAC survives.

FALSAC shows a “seeming existing agency” in a relatively deterministic way.
